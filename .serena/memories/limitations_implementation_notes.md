# Known Limitations and Implementation Notes

## Current Limitations

### Whisper Integration (Critical)
- **Status**: Placeholder implementation only
- **Issue**: `WhisperService` returns mock transcription data
- **Required**: Real whisper.cpp integration via Flutter plugin or FFI bindings
- **Model Format**: Currently expects GGML .bin files but doesn't actually process them
- **Audio Processing**: No actual WAV file parsing or preprocessing implemented

### Platform Support
- **Android Only**: iOS implementation not started
- **Testing**: Only tested on Android emulator/devices
- **Future**: iOS support requires separate implementation

### Model Management
- **No Validation**: Downloaded models are not validated for correctness
- **No Metadata**: No extraction of model information (vocabulary size, parameters, etc.)
- **No Caching**: No intelligent caching or update mechanisms
- **No Comparison**: No benchmarking or model comparison features

### Audio Processing
- **Basic Recording**: Simple WAV recording without advanced preprocessing
- **No Visualization**: No audio waveform or spectrogram visualization
- **Limited Formats**: Only supports WAV output, no other audio formats

## Implementation Requirements for Production

### 1. Real Whisper Integration
```dart
// Current placeholder in whisper_service.dart:
Future<String> transcribeAudio(String audioFilePath) async {
  // TODO: Implement real Whisper inference
  return "This is a mock transcription result.";
}
```

**Options for Real Implementation:**
- **whisper_flutter** plugin (if available)
- **flutter_ffi** with whisper.cpp bindings
- **Custom platform channels** to native whisper.cpp implementation
- **dart:ffi** direct integration with whisper.cpp compiled library

### 2. Model Validation
- GGML file format validation
- Model metadata extraction (size, vocabulary, version)
- Compatibility checking with whisper.cpp version
- Corrupted download detection and re-download capability

### 3. Audio Preprocessing
- Proper WAV file parsing
- Audio normalization and resampling
- Noise reduction (optional)
- Audio format conversion utilities
- Real-time audio processing capabilities

## Architecture Decisions

### Service Layer Pattern
- Clean separation between UI and business logic
- Services handle platform-specific operations
- Dependency injection ready for testing
- Error handling centralized in services

### File Management Strategy
- Models stored in permanent app documents directory
- Recordings in temporary directory with automatic cleanup
- Path management abstracted through services
- Cross-platform file operations

### Permission Strategy
- Runtime permission requests with user explanation
- Graceful degradation when permissions denied
- Permission state monitoring and re-request capability

## Performance Considerations

### Model Size and Storage
- GGML models can be 40-100MB+ depending on quantization
- Need progress tracking for large downloads
- Consider model compression or streaming
- Implement model cleanup for storage management

### Audio Processing Performance
- 16kHz mono WAV format chosen for Whisper compatibility
- Real-time processing may require background threads
- Memory management for large audio files
- Battery usage optimization for extended recording

### Inference Performance
- Whisper models require significant computation
- Consider model quantization for mobile performance
- GPU acceleration if available on device
- Background processing to avoid UI blocking

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

### 1. Advanced Features
- Model benchmarking and comparison tools
- Custom vocabulary injection
- Multiple language support
- Real-time streaming transcription

### 2. User Experience
- Audio visualization during recording
- Transcription confidence scoring
- Export transcriptions in various formats
- Offline model management interface

### 3. Developer Features
- Model performance profiling
- Audio quality analysis
- Transcription accuracy metrics
- Debug logging and diagnostics

## Known Technical Debt
- Placeholder Whisper service needs complete rewrite
- Error handling could be more granular
- UI state management could be improved with state management solution
- Testing coverage needs expansion
- iOS platform implementation completely missing
