- **üìä Voice Spectrogram**: Real-time audio visualization with waveform and frequency bars
- **üîß Smart Permission Handling**: Automatic permission requests with settings navigation
- **üìÅ Model Management**: Download, replace, and delete models with a built-in UI
- **üîÑ Hybrid Support**: Framework ready for both live and offline recognition
- **üì° HuggingFace Integration**: Direct download from HuggingFace model repositories  
- **üåç Multi-language Support**: Supports all languages available on your device
- **‚ö° Production Ready**: Full error handling, user guidance, and robust implementation

## Installation

### Option 1: Install Pre-built APK
1. Download the latest APK from the releases section
2. Enable "Install from unknown sources" in your Android settings
3. Install the APK file: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`
4. Grant microphone and storage permissions when prompted

### Option 2: Build from Source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd test-tiny-whisper

# Get Flutter dependencies
flutter pub get

# Build APK
flutter build apk --release

# Install on connected device
flutter install
```

## Usage

### 1. Download Models
- Open the app and tap the "Model Management" section
- Paste a HuggingFace model URL (see supported models below)
- Tap "Download" and wait for the model to download
- The app will automatically detect the model format (GGML/GGUF/PyTorch)

### 2. Manual Model Installation
If you have models downloaded locally, you can manually place them in the app's directory:

**Android Path**: `/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.example.tiny_whisper_tester/files/models/`

**Steps**:
1. Connect your Android device to a computer via USB
2. Enable USB file transfer mode
3. Navigate to the app's models directory (create it if it doesn't exist)
4. Copy your model files (.bin, .gguf, or .ptl) to this directory
5. Restart the app - models should appear in the Model Management section

**Supported file formats**:
- `.bin` - GGML format from whisper.cpp
- `.gguf` - GGUF format (newer whisper.cpp format)  
- `.ptl` - PyTorch Lite format
- `pytorch_model.bin` - Standard PyTorch format

### 3. Record and Transcribe
1. Select a downloaded model from the dropdown
2. Tap "Start Recording" and speak clearly
3. Tap "Stop Recording" when finished
4. Wait for the transcription result to appear
5. View the transcribed text and accuracy metrics

## Supported Models

### Recommended Models (Tested)
- **openai/whisper-tiny**: Basic English transcription
- **openai/whisper-tiny.en**: English-optimized version
- **distil-whisper/distil-small.en**: Faster, smaller English model

## Development

### Requirements
- Flutter SDK (>=3.10.0)
- Android SDK (API level 23+)
- Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter extension
- Android device or emulator for testing

### Development Commands
```bash
# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run on Android device/emulator
flutter run

# Build debug APK
flutter build apk --debug

# Build release APK
flutter build apk --release

# Clean build artifacts
flutter clean

# Analyze code
flutter analyze

# Run tests
flutter test
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No DevTools instance is registered" message**:
- This is normal when running APKs directly - you can ignore this message
- Only appears in development/debug builds, not in release APKs

**"Model file not found" error**:
- Ensure the model downloaded completely
- Check the models directory path: `/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.example.tiny_whisper_tester/files/models/`
- Try re-downloading the model

**"Permission denied" for microphone**:
- Grant microphone permission in Android settings: Settings > Apps > Tiny Whisper Tester > Permissions
- Restart the app after granting permissions

**"Transcription failed" error**:
- Ensure the audio file was recorded successfully
- Try a different model format
- Check if the model file is corrupted

**Poor transcription quality**:
- Speak clearly and at normal pace
- Reduce background noise
- Try a larger model (base, small, medium)
- Ensure proper microphone positioning

### Production Status

‚úÖ **Production Ready**: The app now uses `speech_to_text` package for reliable speech recognition on Android devices.

**Key Features**:
- Real-time speech recognition using device's built-in speech engine
- Supports multiple languages based on device capabilities
- Requires internet connection for processing (standard for mobile speech recognition)
- Production-ready implementation with error handling

### Speech Recognition vs Model Downloads

**Important Note**: The current production implementation uses live speech recognition rather than downloadable model files. The model download feature remains functional for future development but is not used in the current speech recognition flow.

**Current Workflow**:
1. App initializes speech recognition service
2. User speaks into microphone in real-time
3. Device processes speech using built-in speech engine
4. Results are displayed immediately

### Model Compatibility (For Future Development)

| Format | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| ONNX (.onnx) | üîß Development | For future sherpa_onnx integration |
| GGML (.bin) | üîß Development | For future offline Whisper integration |
| GGUF (.gguf) | üîß Development | For future offline Whisper integration |
| PyTorch (.ptl) | ‚ùå Android Issues | Build conflicts with Android NDK |
