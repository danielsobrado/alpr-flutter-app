The main interface for speech recognition and processing:

1. **Language Selection**: Choose your language or use "Auto-detect"
2. **Start Recording**: Tap the recording button to begin live speech recognition
3. **Real-time Results**: See transcription appear as you speak
4. **Automatic Translation**: Non-English text is automatically translated to English
5. **Summarisation**: Use the "Summarise" button to create concise summaries

### **Models Tab**
Manage Whisper models for offline speech recognition:

1. **Download Models**: Paste HuggingFace URLs and download Whisper models
2. **Model Selection**: Choose between different model sizes and languages
3. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor download progress with visual indicators
4. **Model Replacement**: Replace existing models with newer versions

### **Languages Tab** 
Manage translation language models:

1. **Browse Languages**: View all 50+ supported translation languages
2. **Download Models**: One-click download of language packs
3. **Model Status**: See which languages are ready for offline translation
4. **Storage Management**: Delete unused language models to save space

### **Settings Tab**
Configure summarisation models and app preferences:

1. **Summarisation Models**: Download Gemma 2B, 7B, or Gemini Nano models
2. **Model Selection**: Choose your preferred summarization model
3. **Summary Settings**: Adjust summary length and generation parameters
4. **Storage Info**: Monitor model storage usage and free up space

## Quick Start Guide

1. **Grant Permissions**: Allow microphone and storage access when prompted
2. **Download Translation Models**: Go to the Languages tab, download models for your languages
3. **Download Summarization Model**: Go to Settings tab, download Gemma-2B (recommended)
4. **Start Recording**: Go to the Speech tab, tap "Start Listening" and speak
5. **View Results**: See transcription, translation, and use "Summarise" for key points

## Supported Models

### Recommended Models (Tested)
- **openai/whisper-tiny**: Basic English transcription
- **openai/whisper-tiny.en**: English-optimized version
- **distil-whisper/distil-small.en**: Faster, smaller English model

## Development

### Requirements
- Flutter SDK (>=3.10.0)
- Android SDK (API level 23+)
- Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter extension
- Android device or emulator for testing

### Development Commands
```bash
# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run on Android device/emulator
flutter run

# Build debug APK
flutter build apk --debug

# Build release APK
flutter build apk --release

# Clean build artefacts
flutter clean

# Analyse code
flutter analyze

# Run tests
flutter test
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No DevTools instance is registered" message**:
- This is normal when running APKs directly - you can ignore this message
- Only appears in development/debug builds, not in release APKs

**"Model file not found" error**:
- Ensure the model is downloaded completely
- Check the models directory path: `/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.example.tiny_whisper_tester/files/models/`
- Try re-downloading the model

**"Permission denied" for microphone**:
- Grant microphone permission in Android settings: Settings > Apps > Tiny Whisper Tester > Permissions
- Restart the app after granting permissions

**"Transcription failed" error**:
- Ensure the audio file was recorded successfully
- Try a different model format
- Check if the model file is corrupted

**Poor transcription quality**:
- Speak clearly and at a normal pace
- Reduce background noise
- Try a larger model (base, small, medium)
- Ensure proper microphone positioning

### Production Status

**Production Ready**: The app now uses `speech_to_text` package for reliable speech recognition on Android devices.

**Key Features**:
- Real-time speech recognition using the device's built-in speech engine
- Supports multiple languages based on device capabilities
- Requires internet connection for processing (standard for mobile speech recognition)
- Production-ready implementation with error handling

### Speech Recognition vs Model Downloads

**Important Note**: The current production implementation uses live speech recognition rather than downloadable model files. The model download feature remains functional for future development, but is not used in the current speech recognition flow.

**Current Workflow**:
1. App initialises speech recognition service
2. User speaks into the microphone in real-time
3. Device processes speech using built-in speech engine
4. Results are displayed immediately

### Model Compatibility (For Future Development)

| Format | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| ONNX (.onnx) | 🔧 Development | For future sherpa_onnx integration |
| GGML (.bin) | 🔧 Development | For future offline Whisper integration |
| GGUF (.gguf) | 🔧 Development | For future offline Whisper integration |
| PyTorch (.ptl) | ❌ Android Issues | Build conflicts with Android NDK |
